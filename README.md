# To simply run:
1. Go to the _dist_ dir and run `php -S 0.0.0.0:1337`
2. In the browser, type http://0.0.0.0:1337/

# To mess around:
1. Make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) installed. (If `node -v`works, you have.)
2. From the root dir of the project, run `npm install`.
3. Now, run `bower install`.
4. Run `gulp` to build and start watching for changes in the _src_ dir
5. Open a new terminal tab and run `cd dist && php -S 0.0.0.0:1337`
6. Start messing around with the src-files.
